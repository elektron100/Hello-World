My name is William John Dager.  I am 66-years-old and retired.  My lifetime career was as a senior Electronics/Electromechanical  Engineering Technician.  I worked mainly with analog electronics and later with microcontrollers.  Between 1977 and 1981, I was in the U.S. Air Force where I repaired the automatic flight control  (autopilot and flight stability augmentation and gyrocompass systems) systems on C-5A, C141A & B aircraft at Dover AFB in Delaware.  In 1978, a friend and I built a hobby computer by Southwest Technical Products, the SWTP 6800, based on the Motorola 6800 microprocessor.  Worked later with the Intel 8048/49, 8031/51 microcontroller, biomedical electronics, robotics and automation, lasers (gas, dye, solid state), electrochemistry equipment, lock-in amplifiers, cell phone equipment and more.  Mostly now, I am learning about the Arduino series of MCU boards, learning C, Python programming, Linux and related things.  I plan to get into design and automation of drones for agriculture and other applications using GPS, magnetic and inertial navigation techniques for control.
